# NMIMS-GPA-Calculator-Sem1-C-Division
This is my first-ever project in the field of Computer Science, built using the C programming language.
It calculates your GPA based on the scores you enter, following the NMIMS Semester-1 subjects.
NOTE:-(Please read the instructions carefully before using the program.)

-How to Run the Program?:-
You can run this C project in any environment that supports the C language.
Steps:
1)Open the code file in the repository.
2)Copy the code.
3)Paste and run it in:
Any online C compiler, or VS Code, or
Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or
Any C compiler of your choice.


-Subjects Included in GPA Calculation:-
This project includes all Semester-1 subjects of NMIMS C-Division:
1)Physics
2)CTPS (Computational Thinking for Problem Solving Skills)
3)Calculus
4)EOB (Elements of Biology)
5)EGD (Engineering Graphics and Drawing)
6)EEP (Essentials of Electronic Practices)
7)EE (Engineering Ethics)
8)IKS (Indian Knowledge System)
9)ES (Environmental Science)

-Concepts Used:-
1)This project uses basic C programming concepts such as:
2)if–else conditions
3)Nested conditional statements
4)User input handling
5)Basic arithmetic calculations

-Purpose of the Project:-
1)Help students quickly calculate their Semester-1 GPA
2)Practice and demonstrate foundational knowledge of the C programming language
3)Build confidence by making a complete working project
