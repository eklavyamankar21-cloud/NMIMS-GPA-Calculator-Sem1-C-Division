The given repository contains two different types of codes that calculate your GPA. The normal code which is gpacalculatorsem1.c calculates your gpa normally. But, there is another code file which is gpacalculatorenhanced.c . In the enhanced version of the code file, after your calculation is done, it will ask the user whether if the user wants to calculate the GPA again or not, hence the user can calculate the GPA in the enhanced code 'n' number of times without closing the terminal again and again.
